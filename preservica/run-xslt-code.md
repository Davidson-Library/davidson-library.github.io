# Run XSLT Code

* Open both the downloaded DC bib `.xml` file and the [Split\_Single\_to\_Multiple\_XML\_Files.xsl file](../Split\_Single\_to\_Multiple\_XML\_Files.xsl) in Oxygen XML Editor.
* Click the XSLT Debugger perspective button
![XSLT Debugger View](../help\_files/Rename\_XSLT\_Debugger.png)
* Make sure you have the two files selected (exported `.xml` file and `.xsl` file).
* Select where you want the individual files saved. I'd recommend saving local instead of the Preservica server folder. **Click the "Run to End"** button ![Oxygen Setup](../help\_files/XSTL\_Setup2.png)

The files will now appear in the Output directory you selected.
