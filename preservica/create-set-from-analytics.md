# Create Set From Analytics

Now that the collection has been saved as an analysis, you can create a set "From Analytics." Back in Alma, select **Admin** then **Manage Sets**

![Admin Manage Sets](../help\_files/Analytics\_Admin\_Manage.png)

**Click Add Set** then **Itemized**

![Add Set](../help\_files/Analytics\_Create\_Set.png)

Give the set a name (probably the name of the collection), **select Digital titles** from the "Set content type" dropdown, and **select From Analytics.** Alma will take a bit to process all the directories in analytics. Now's a good time for a stretch üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or coffee :coffee: (seriously).

The folder will default to "Recent reports" and the analysis you just saved doesn't always show up there. **Select** the `Davidson College 01DCOLL_INST/Reports/Alma Digital` folder directory and then the name of the analysis in the field below the folder. **Click Save**. You'll receive an email when the set has be created (usually instantly)

It will now show up as a set under **My Sets**. :tada:
